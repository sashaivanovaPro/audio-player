# Audio Player Project

A web-based audio player built with vanilla JavaScript, focused on progressive enhancement.

## Current Features

The vanilla JavaScript implementation includes:

- Play/pause functionality
- Next/previous track navigation
- Progress bar with time display
- Dynamic background changes based on the current track
- Track information display (artist, title, duration)
- Manual track seeking via progress bar

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML document
- `style.css` - Styles for the player
- `script.js` - JavaScript logic
- `assets/` - Contains images and audio files
  - `images/` - UI elements and track artwork
  - `audio/` - Music files for playback

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. No build steps required - this is pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

## Development Roadmap

This project follows an incremental development approach:

1. **Vanilla JS Base Implementation** (current) - Basic player functionality
2. **OOP Refactoring** - Restructuring code using Object-Oriented Programming principles
3. **Advanced Features** - Adding play modes (repeat one, repeat all, shuffle)
4. **Modular Architecture** - Breaking down the application into modules for better maintainability

## Branches

- `main` - Main project branch
- `vanilla-js` - Current vanilla JavaScript implementation
- `feature/oop-refactoring` - Upcoming OOP implementation (work in progress)
